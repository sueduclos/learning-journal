## Operators and Loops

*_Comparison operators_ - operators that compare values and return single values `true` or `false`. The operators include: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `===` and `!==`.

*_Logical operators_ - operators that combine multiple boolean expressions or values and provide a single boolean output. The operators include: `&&`, `||`, and `!`.

Loops - `for` and `while`

Loops can execute a block of code a number of times. Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

`for` Loop:

``` 
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

`while` Loop:

```
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```
