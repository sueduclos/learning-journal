## Introducing CSS
CSS allows you to create rules to specify how the content of an element should appear. 

* Rules are made up of *selectors* (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and *declarations* (that indicate what these elements should look like)

* Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements

* Declarations - made of two parts
    * properties 
    * values 

* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an **HTML** page
