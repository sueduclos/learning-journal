## Intro to Javascript
Three languages make us webpages
* HTML = content layer 
* CSS = presentation layer
* Javascript = behavior layer

It's best to keep Javascript code in its own Javascript file. These files are text files with the .js extension
The HTML script elements used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the Javascript file

* **Statements**
    * are instructions and each one starts on a new line
    * can be organized into code blocks
    * should end with a semicolon

* **Comments**
    * explain what your code does
    * make your code easier to read
        * mulit-line comments 
        * single-line comments

* **Variables**

* **Data Types**
    * numeric data type
    * string data type
    * boolean data type
