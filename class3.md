## Class 3

## GIT and GitHub

**GIT (Version Control system):** Where I store code
* Track differences in files
* Lives on your computer
* Make changes, make commits, upload to GitHub
* Tracks history

**GitHub (Online Code Storage):** Remote/online of GIT
* Online place that manages your projects in GIT
* Keep your files there in a repository (REPO)
* Your code in the cloud

**Common terms:**
* Commits - snapshots in time; same as "Save As"
* HEAD - "You are here"
* Repository (REPO) - is a collection of files that you've told GIT to pay attention to
  * usually one project = one repository


### Commands

* touch = create a file
* mkdir = create a folder
* git add = pay attention, going to save
* git commit = lock it in stone; save
* git push = takes code and pushes to GitHub
* git status = tells you where you are at in the process
* clear or control L = clears screen
