## How Computers Work

What makes a computer a computer? 

**A computer is a machine that helps with thinking.**

* **Four things common to all computers**
    1. Input- keyboard, mouse. Ways of getting information into your computer
    2. Storage- hard drive, flash memory. Where information is stored.
    3. Processing- CPU, chip. Where information is processed.
    4. Output- screen display or printer. Displays or outputs information digitally or permanently.

* **Binary and Data**
    <ul>   
    <li> Computers work on Ones and Zeros.</li>
    <li> Inside computers there are wires and circuits that carry information in a computer. </li>
    <li> A single wire with electricity in it can be ON or OFF </li>
    </ul> 

**BIT** = smallest piece of information that a computer can store. With more bits you can represent more complex data. The binary system only uses two digits, 0 and 1. 

`1 WIRE - 0 and 1`

`2 WIRE - 00  01 10 11`
