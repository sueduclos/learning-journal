### The Coder's Computer

#### Text Editors

A text editor allows you to write and manage text that you write to build a website. It's important for software developers to choose the text editor that works best for them in order to be successful and accomplish more with less effort. 

* **Basic Text Editor**
  * Every computer comes with its own editor. Does not have many features.

* **Code-Specific Editor**
  * Third- party options that can be downloaded. Offer more features like: 
 
 > Code completion, syntax highlighting, themes, and extensions.


* **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**
  * All in one software package - a text editor, file manager, a compiler, and debugger.
