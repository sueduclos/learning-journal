### Growth Mindset

When learning, growth mindset is the key to one's success. It's believing that you are in control of your own learning. Talent, intelligence and abilities can be increased through hard work and effort. 

In the words of **Irving Berlin**:
>Talent is only the starting point.

***Growth Mindset Reminders***

1. I am on the right track
2. This may take time and effort
3. I haven't figured it out YET


### The Coder's Computer

#### Text Editors

A text editor allows you to write and manage text that you write to build a website.

* Basic Text Editor
  * Every computer comes with its own editor. Does not have many features.

* Code-Specific Editor
  * Third- party options that can be downloaded. Offer more features like: 
 > Code completion, syntax highlighting, themes, and extensions.

* IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
 * All in one software package - a text editor, file manager, a compiler, and debugger.
