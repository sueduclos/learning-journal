### Growth Mindset

When learning, growth mindset is the key to one's success. It's believing that you are in control of your own learning. Talent, intelligence and abilities can be increased through hard work and effort. 

In the words of **Irving Berlin**:
>Talent is only the starting point.

***Growth Mindset Reminders***

1. I am on the right track
2. This may take time and effort
